| [<img src="/images/ite_watt_competition_paper.png" width="1200">](/files/ite_watt_competition_paper.pdf) | *Charging Up Opinions: Unveiling Canadian Sentiments on Electric Vehicles (EVs) through Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling of Reddit Data* | Competition Paper | June 2024 | <span style="color:orange">some ***Recipent of ITE Canada/WATT Consulting Group "Transportation in a Sustainable World" Student Award (Awarded based on the quality and appreciation of interdisciplinary collaboration).*** text</span> <br> <br> Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were performed on extracted Reddit data to determine overall polarity (i.e., positive, negative, neutral) and most shared topics regarding Reddit posts and comments on Canadian perceptions of electric vehicles (EV). Results suggested an overall positive polarity regarding EV discussions. The most common topics discussed are EV ownership and incentives, EV models available in Canada, and EV operational needs such as charging infrastructure and time.|

Results suggested an Artificial Neural Network predicts PIL accurately while minimizing the false negative rate.|

DTA models require specific input parameters, such as signal timing plans and turn counts, which were missing from the ASET model. This led to the assumption that all intersections were unsignalized, which failed to calibrate the model correctly.|

These solutions combine safety ideas from the school kids' and engineering perspectives and utilize Standards and Policies related to active transportation safety.
